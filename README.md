# AI Stream Interact 🧠🎞️ aims to provide basic LLM interaction capabilities with video streams.
This package can easily be extended to accommodate different LLMs, but for this first version interactions were implemented only for [Google's Gemini Pro & Vision Pro Models](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials)

**Note: This is a basic Alpha version that's been written & tested in Ubuntu only so it may have unexpected behavior with other operating systems.**

## Example Usage:

- Step1: make sure you have a USB camera connected and that it is detected
